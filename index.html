              Florence and the Machine (styled as Florence + The Machine) are an
              English indie rock band that formed in London in 2007, consisting
              of lead singer Florence Welch, keyboardist Isabella Summers, and a
              collaboration of other artists. The band's music received praise
              across the media, especially from the BBC, which played a large
              part in their rise to prominence by promoting Florence and the
              Machine as part of BBC Introducing. At the 2009 Brit Awards they
              received the Brit Awards "Critics' Choice" award. The band's music
              is renowned for its dramatic and eccentric production and also
              Welch's powerful vocal performances.

              The band's debut studio album, Lungs, was released on 6 July 2009,
              and held the number-two position for its first five weeks on the
              UK Albums Chart. On 17 January 2010, the album reached the top

              the United Kingdom for sixty-five consecutive weeks, making it one
              of the best-selling albums of 2009 and 2010. The group's second
              studio album, Ceremonials, released in October 2011, entered the
              charts at number one in the UK and number six in the US. The
              band's third album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, was released
              on 2 June 2015. It topped the UK charts, and debuted at number one
              on the US Billboard 200, their first to do so. The album reached

              twenty. Also in 2015, the band was the headlining act at
